// 10. We will make a deck of cards -- sort of.
// Create an empty array called deck.
// Make a for loop that goes from 1 to 13.
// Inside that for loop make another for loop that goes from 1 to 4.
// Do NOT use i for both for loops! You can use j if you want.
// Inside the inner for loop:
// Create an empty string
// If the outer loop variable is 2-10 add that number to the empty string.
// However, if it's 1, add A, if it's 11 add J, if it's 12 and Q, if it's 13 and K.
// This is the value of the card (2-10, Ace, Jack, Queen, King)
// Then, using the inner loop, add the suit.
// If it's 1 add "clubs", for 2 add "diamonds", for 3 add "spades", for 4 add "hearts"
// Then, add this string onto the array.
// After both loops are done, print out both the length of the array (should be 52)
// as well as the array itself, which should look like a deck of cards
// Something like: ["Aclubs", "Adiamonds", "Aspades", "Ahearts", "2Clubs", "2Diamonds", ...]
